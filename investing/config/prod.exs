# you won't find the :http configuration below, but set inside
# InvestingWeb.Endpoint.init/2 when load_from_system_env is

#
# Don't forget to configure the url host to something meaningful,
# Phoenix uses this information when generating URLs.
#
# Finally, we also include the path to a cache manifest
# containing the digested version of static files. This
# manifest is generated by the mix phx.digest task
# which you typically run after static files are built.
