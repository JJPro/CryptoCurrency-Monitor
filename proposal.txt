Currency Price Monitoring

What our app lets users do?
As for now, Bitcoin is one of hot digital currency which is desirable and limited.
It is well known in the market. Our team is going to develop an web application
for cryptocurrency traders, investors, and financial analysts to monitor and get
alerts about cryptocurrency price fluctuations as well as other financial assets
on NASDAQ/DOW. Users can use our developed application to monitor preferred
assets prices for all exchanges. In addition, they can set thresholds for their
preferred assets prices and then get email alerts. Users can also have great view
for price fluctuations with beautiful charts. What’s more, users can get instant
notification when there is an arbitrage opportunity for their selected type of
assets. Last but not least, our platform will support paper trading.


Which external API(s) you will use, how, and why?
We decide to use an external web API called Coinbase for cryptocurrency and
Alpha Vantage API or Intrinio API for other financial assets data in the
server-side of our application. These powerful APIs would help us pull
real-time price updates on the assets. Also, Coinbase provides both API key for
data access and OAuth2 for authentication, which will be helpful for security
consideration.


What data you will store in your database?
In the database, we are supposed to store user profiles and custom settings,
which includes salt hashed login credentials, users’ asset portfolios, current
balance, current earnings etc.


How you plan to build your UI?
As for UI, our application will support the following two models for login.
Users can either login with their own username and password, or OAuthed from
a third-party provider. In the main page, users can log out, edit their profiles
and custom settings, and choose preferred assets to monitor. Also, there is a
page for users to use their predefined amount of balance to make simulated
trades and view their virtual earnings/losses so as to practice their
investment skills.
